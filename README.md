# go-weather

Basic weather app built with Go.

DISCLAIMER: This is my first ever Go app. In fact, first ever time with the Go language. This readme is likely not enough to actually get started.

This app was based on [this tutorial](http://www.sitepoint.com/go-building-web-applications-beego/).

# Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Go](http://golang.org/) configured for your machine.

2. Ensure you have [Beego](http://beego.me/) installed & configured.

3. Clone the repo & install dependencies

  ```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:sman591/go-weather.git
  $ cd go-weather
  ```

4. Startup the local development environment

  ```bash
  bee run
  ```

5. Visit http://localhost:9000

# Deployment

Nothing yet. Maybe never. Maybe some time soon. Who knows.
